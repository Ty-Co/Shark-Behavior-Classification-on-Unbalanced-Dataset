This project was done in google colab. 

It is suggested to run each section of the code seperately.

When importing the data to the data make sure that the files are in the same directory.
Change the directory:
	dir = '.../Project/dataset'

To train the different the oversampling methods for the KNN
 1. Go to OVER SAMPLED KNN
 2. change all the xtrain_ and ytrain_
	a.train1,ytrain1 => SMOTE-SVM
	b.train2,ytrain2 => SMOTE
	c.train3,ytrain3 => ADASYN
